# Building-a-Neural-Network-from-scratch
A neural network with all the necessary functions for forward and backward propagation built in python.

### Neural Network Structure:

L layer neural network and the output layer prediction is based on Logistic Regression.Softmax activation function has also been added.

#### Activation functions:

Hidden layers -- Relu Function
Output layer -- Sigmoid Function

These helper functions can be used to build a L-Layer neural network.
